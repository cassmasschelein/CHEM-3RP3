# CHEM-3RP3
Code written to fit a quadratic to reaction pathways as part of a project completed for a research course at McMaster University.

This python script includes the necessary code to do reaction fitting and graph drawing. Before using the code you must install miniconda, and python 3 is preferred. Both numpy and matplotlib are required to run this code successfully. Once you have downloaded the "solve_quad.py" file, open your python interpreter and use the code in "draw_graph.py" to solve the quadratic automatically and return a graph for the reaction path. Replace "number1" with the energy of the reactant, replace "number2" with the energy of the transition state, and replace "number3" with the energy of the product for any particular reaction pathway you are trying to model.
